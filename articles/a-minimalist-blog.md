# A minimalist blog

**TL;DR** GitHub has a very nice interface to write MarkDown files. So I made a script to regularly translate that into HTML and voil√†, here is my nice little blog.

After reading so many good posts from my peers and having a few nice small projects in mind, I felt is was time for me to do it. I wanted to share my point of view, to give back, to start my own blog. But I had my opinion on this, of course. As a developer there were some obvious: Markdown for pleasant formatting, git to keep stuff well organized and backed-up. But I also wanted to stay in complete control and keep things simple and efficient. Which means having it selfhosted under my own domain. No SaaS, no cloud, no fancy framework. Hey you know what? While we are at it, no cutom font, no cookies, no dynamic rendering, no Javascript, not even HTML attributes. Back to the basics. Just semantic HTML and CSS, provided by the most boring HTTP server.

## The 4 levels of blogging

1. Chef at the restaurant.
You blog on a dedicated platform like Medium.
People were coming here before and will continue to come after you.
If your boss don't like your dishes they won't make it out of the kitchen.

2. The furnished place.
You blog on the host-provided wordpress.
This is now a well identificable place with a personnal touch but nothing out of the ordinary.
You must keep using this aging oven, forget the barbecue.

3. The unfurnished place.
You run your own software on provided servers.
There is something special about this place, people come here to spend some good time more than satisfy their hunger.
You still can't drill the walls.

4. The hut in the woods.
You self-host your blog.
People come from afar to taste the truffles you find in the woods.
A peaceful life for you, a priceless moment for them.
