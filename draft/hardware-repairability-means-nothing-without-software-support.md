# Hardware repairability means nothing without software support

## Security is non-negotiable

First I'd like to address the argument that it's fine to not have security updates. You smartphone store very sensitive information.
Can you imagine all that someone with access to your phone could do?
Empty your bank account, use your identity, find anything about your personnal life, ruin your internet reputation, lock you out of any account.
It can make your life hell.  
You may say that you're not a very important person and that nobody would bother to do that to you. What about a larger attack?
What if a breach that affects thousands of people like you were found and anyone connected to the internet could trigger that?
The value of such attack estimates in millions.
There is also the possibility that someone, for whatever reason, really hates you and want to ruin your life.
When your device has no known vulnerability, it's very expensive to get someone hack into it. When that's not the case, much less.
In that case it's in the book, waiting for you to use it.

By assuming that no such serious breach will be found in the future and that you'll never be a target anyway you gamble a large portion of your life on 
known unknown. We know that such breach can exist, what we don't know if it will actually be discovered and exploited in the future.
It's not an unknown unknown. So the impact would be very high and the risk is there. You shouldn't take it.
