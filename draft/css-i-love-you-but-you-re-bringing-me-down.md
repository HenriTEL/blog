# CSS, I love you, but you're bringing me down

Here are a few verses inspired by [LCD Soundsystem - New York, I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down](https://youtu.be/-eohHwsplvY?si=7BrPWaLrTOlEPK0D) with help from ChatGPT.

**[Verse 1]**  
Style Sheets, I love you, but you're bringing me down  
Like a rat in a cage, pulling minimum wage, <!-- change  -->
Style Sheets, I love you, but you're bringing me down  
Style Sheets, I love you, but you're bringing me down  

<!-- change  -->
Z-index stacking, the stacking order game  
Absolute and relative, not quite the same.  
Box model surprises, breaking my stride,  
Overflow hidden, where my content hides.  

**[Verse 2]**  
Style Sheets, I love you, but you're a tangled mess  
Selectors and rules always causing distress  
How does this content flows? is still my daily fight  
But now the display types, a maze always in sight  

Style Sheets, you're stronger and you're wasting my time  
The web archives all show you were weird but just fine  
Then they patched you and stitched you, in a disastrous way  
Masonry layout, is this still web design?
