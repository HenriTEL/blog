# My London real estate agency is a crook

> I've spent about 1.5 years in London and now that I'm back to Paris I'd like to share my tenant experience with one of the most popular real estate agency.
> Some things are probably the fault of the current law, some from the Landlord. Anyway, here is what thay came up with.

The rental was for a 2 Bedrooms unfurnished flat, approx. 70m2.

* 2 years contract, I was lucky to have a break clause that includes the case of a far enough job transfer. Cause you know, such difficult time to find new tenants in the area.
* The check-in and check-out inventories were both conducted without me being present.
* +15% increase on the monthly payments for the next tenant, cause those inflation rates were rookie numbers.
* Paid for their recommanded cleaning service, who cleaned almost nothing (there was not much remaining to clean, and remember, it's an unfurnished flat). So they took about the same amout from my deposit. Total cost: Â£565.

On the bright side:
* They didn't ask for a third party to act as bail.
