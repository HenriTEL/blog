# My London real estate agency is a crook

> I've spent about 1.5 years in London and now that I'm back to Paris I'd like to share my tenant experience with one of the most popular real estate agency.
> Some things are probably the fault of the current law, some from the Landlord. Anyway, here is what thay came up with.

The rental was for a 2 Bedrooms unfurnished flat, approx. 70m2.

* 2 years contract, I was lucky to have a break clause that includes the case of a far enough job transfer. Cause you know, such difficult time to find new tenants in the area.
* The check-in and check-out inventories were both conducted without me being present.
* An agent went to check the appartement at least once a year, never seen anything like that in France.
* +15% increase on the monthly payments for the next tenant, cause those inflation rates were rookie numbers.
* Paid for their recommanded cleaning service, who cleaned almost nothing (there was not much remaining things to clean, and remember, it's an unfurnished flat). So they took another £300 from my deposit. Total cost: £565.
* Got my deposit back more than 1 month after the end of tenancy.

On the bright side, they didn't ask for a third party to act as bail as it's usually the ase in Paris.

In coparison, it's unbelievable how the law turned in favor of the tenant in France. In a town like Paris:

* Rents are strictly framed to not go beyond certain amounts
* The tenant just has a 1 month notice to terminate the lease contract no matter the reason
* Landlords can't expel tenants as long as they pay the bills, even after the end of the lease. Tenants can be expelled at the end of the lease if the property gets sold to someone else.
* Tenants have 10 days to modify the check-in inventory once it's done.
