I'm not sure I want to publish that as it turns out that gitlab it getting quite close to feature parity with GH.

# In defense of GitHub

> Since GitHub has been bought by Microsof and started training AIs on the code it is hosting, there have been a growing crowd of unhappy devs.
Here's why I think, on the contrary, that GitHub is still a very nice place to work on OSS.

First, let's clarify that I'm talking about free projects (as in freedom) that use the free tier (as in nothing to pay).
Proprietary software, private repositories and projects paying to be hosted on GitHub are another concern that are out of the scope of this article.  

## They are the best

There's simply no alternative that comes close to what GH can provide for free. Think about it:
* Virtually unlimited hosting.
* Top knoch service availability (99.9% quarterly uptime commitment).
* Continuous pipelines, aka CI and CD but not only, via Actions.
* Vulnerability detection and automated patching.
* Project management with issues and the Projects feature.
* Documentation via its Markdown support and the wiki.
* Live editing from the main website or via Codespaces.
* Website hosting via pages.
* Instant cross-repositories code search.
* Package registry for various formats notably containers, npm and ruby gems.
* A full-featured and well documented API to automate all that.
* And many more...

Github even help remuneration of OSS via the sponsors feature and its accelerator program.
And of course there is the community; with all this added value it's no surprise that it has become the central point of most OSS development.
Once you're there, it's arguably much easier to have good visibility, get feedback or find contributors.

## Alternatives are not there

You may say that there are alternatives, e.g. GitLab or Codeberg. But are they really?
I've tried Codeberg but the CI capabilities are still in testing phase, while Actions exists since 2018 and goes beyond CI.
I know gitlab well bu to get use
