# Documentation Done Right

When adding diagrams, drawings or generated images, make sure to always link the source of your work and give access to colleages, so that they can easily update it.
Have a common structure between projects documentations so that users find familiarity[^1]. If it's a local file (.psd, .svg, etc.), upload it somewhere accessible and link to that.

Setup some sanity checks to be aware of e.g. broken links.
