# Android Sucks on Google Phones

What happened to the gifted child android stock was in 2010?    
At the beginning I though you were just a bit stubborn with that color scheme where all of your apps looks the same.  
But then you started to force your search bar into my ~throat~ home screen.  
Then you did it again with that *At Glance* widget.  
Now it's getting even more cringe when, for the 3rd time in the month you tell me I should really really turn on backup for my photos on you server, even if I already have an app that back them up on my NAS.  
That's embarassing, I need to hide you with a launcher now.
